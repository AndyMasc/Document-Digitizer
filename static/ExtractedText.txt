Whale Rider, a film directed by Niki Caro, is a captivating and compelling movie that documents
a Maori girl's quest to assume a role in a culture that is rigidly structured around gender and
leadership. Whale Rider is emotive and thought-provoking, and most notably the way that the
film handles the burden of tradition and the courage needed to challenge it.

At the beginning of “whale rider’, | felt so frustrated at the unfairness of the rules of culture,
particularly those that were imposed on women. It was painful to watch Paikea be dismissed
and overlooked just because she was a girl, while she was so clearly a leader at heart. This is
foreshadowed with Koro, Paikea’s granddad, who is distraught at the loss of the male successor
and is not willing to accept Paikea to take on the new role. His disappointment establishes the
basis of the conflict, that leadership would have to be a male member of the family, not a female
one, even if Paikea is a natural born leader. This made me realize how in some cultures, or
some households, individuals are still more judged on their gender rather on who they truly are
and what they are capable of. | began thinking of areas where individuals within my life, or
myself sometimes, were expected to behave a certain way simply based on who we were, not
on who we really were. The movie made me reflect on the fact that traditions can be such a
beautiful aspect, but also so damaging, depending on implementation.
